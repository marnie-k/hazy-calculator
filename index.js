const calculate = () => {
  /*
1. What does it do?
runs an arithmetic calculation based upon an array of inputs 
(eg. `[2, '*', 10]`) 

2. What  are the inputs (parameters)?
an  array that can contain numbers, strings, empty strings, null, zeros

3. What is the output?
a number or NaN

for all tests:
for loop??? beecause of array
variable a defined
operator defined
variable b defined

stringified numbers -> converted to numbers
Null -> converted to zero
non-numeric strings -> ignored
operator -> identified and operation assigned


test 1 -> one number is stringified

test 2 -> null === 0

test 3 ->  ignore empty strings and continue operation

test 4 -> ignore non-numeric strings and continue operation

test 5 -> return NaN if no operator
